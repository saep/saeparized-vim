# saeparized-vim

I used the excellent solarized color theme http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
created by Ethan Schoonover for quite some time, but I started to get a little
annoyed by the greenish background and started to create my own. As the vim
color script file was derived from the solarized one, I kind of named the color
theme after it with a touch of me.

## Installation

### Pathogen

Simply clone the repository into your /bundle/ folder. For a default
configuration this should suffice:

> git clone https://github.com/saep/saeparized-vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/saeparized

### Manually

Copy the saeparized.vim to your vim configurations colors folder. For a default
configuration the folder should be located at:

> ~/.vim/colors

If the folder does not exist, simply create it.

## Terminal colors

For terminals that use the ~/.Xresources file, the color definitions can be
found here:
